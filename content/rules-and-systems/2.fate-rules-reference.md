This document covers where to find the rules for the Fate Core RPG.

If you don't know where to start I recommend the **Fate Condensed**
book and read through that for a compact view of the rules.

The Fate SRD site has all the rules we will be using, including Fate
Condensed, and more.

Physical books can be purchased at your friendly local gaming store, or
online from the publisher's website.

The **Fate Core**, **Fate Accelerated**, and **Fate Condensed** books
all describe the same game, "Fate Core", with the "dials" set in
slightly different ways, depending on the game you want to play.

* **Fate Core** - [https://fate-srd.com/fate-core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core)
  * Describes all the rules along with lots of examples and
    explanations, and presents a typical setting that is used for those
    examples. (310 pages in the PDF)

* **Fate Accelerated** -  [https://fate-srd.com/fate-accelerated](https://fate-srd.com/fate-accelerated)
  * Pares the Fate Core rules down to a particular set of options,
    optimized for quick play. It uses "Approaches" instead of "Skills". (50
    pages in the PDF)

* **Fate Condensed** - [https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed)
  * Also pares down the rules and descriptions from Fate Core, and
    clarifies some rule descriptions based on the intervening 7-8 years from
    when Fate Core was published. (66 pages in the PDF.)

* **Fate System Toolkit** - [https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit](https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit)
  * This toolkit book includes a number of additional options to
    use in your game that were left out of Fate Core, and includes more descriptions of
    how to change the system to suit your needs. It includes more detailed
    options for magic, superpowers, cyberware and vehicles. (186 pages in
    the PDF.)

* **Four Color FAE** - [https://four-color-fae.gitbooks.io/four-color-fae/content/](https://four-color-fae.gitbooks.io/four-color-fae/content/)
  * This third party book includes explanatory text about using narrative permissions to model super powers,
    using an additional section on the character sheet to list out **Power Facts** about a character's powers. Use these
    Power Facts to specify details of how a character's powers (named in one of the character's Aspects) work.

This document covers where to find the rules for the Fate Core RPG.

If you don't know where to start I recommend the **Fate Condensed**
books and read through that for a compact view of the rules.

The Fate SRD site has all the rules we will be using, including Fate
Condensed, and more.

Physical books can be purchased at your friendly local gaming store, or
online from the publisher's website.

The **Fate Core**, **Fate Accelerated**, and **Fate Condensed** books
all describe the same game, "Fate Core", with the "dials" set in
slightly different ways, depending on the game you want to play.

**Fate Core** describes all the rules along with lots of examples and
explanations, and presents a typical setting that is used for those
examples. (310 pages in the PDF, online at
[https://fate-srd.com/fate-core](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core).)

**Fate Accelerated** pares that down to a particular set of options,
optimized for quick play. It uses "Approaches" instead of "Skills". (50
pages in the PDF, online at
[https://fate-srd.com/fate-accelerated](https://fate-srd.com/fate-accelerated).)

**Fate Condensed** also pares down the rules and descriptions, and
clarifies some rule descriptions based on the intervening 7-8 years from
when Fate Core was published. (66 pages in the PDF,
[https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed](https://fate-srd.com/fate-condensed).)

The **Fate System Toolkit** includes a number of additional options to
use that were left out of Fate Core, and includes more descriptions of
how to change the system to suit your needs, including more detailed
options for magic, superpowers, cyberware and vehicles. (186 pages in
the PDF, online at
[https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit](https://fate-srd.com/fate-system-toolkit).)

The **Four Color FAE** book includes explanatory text about using narrative permissions to model super or meta powers, using an additional section to list out **Power Facts** to specify details of how a character's powers work as referenced in the character's power related Aspect.

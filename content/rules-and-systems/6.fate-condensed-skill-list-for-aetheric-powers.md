### Academics

Mundane, everyday human knowledge and education,
including history, sciences, and medicine. Academics stunts often
refer to specialized areas of knowledge and medical skills.

### Athletics

A measurement of physical potential. Athletics stunts
focus on movement---running, jumping, parkour---and dodging attacks.

### Burglary

Knowledge of and ability to bypass security systems,
pick pockets, and generally commit crimes. Burglary stunts give
bonuses to the various stages of committing a crime, from the planning
to the execution and escape.

### Contacts

Knowledge of the right people and connections that can
help you. Contacts stunts give you ready allies and an information
network wherever you go in the world.

### Deceive

Ability to lie and cheat convincingly and with aplomb.
Deceive stunts might improve your ability to tell a particular breed
of lie or help invent false identities.

### Drive

Controlling vehicles under the most grueling circumstances, pulling
wicked maneuvers, and simply getting the most out of your ride. Drive
stunts can be signature maneuvers, a special vehicle of your own, or the
ability to use Drive in place of a skill like Burglary or Academics under
certain circumstances.

### Empathy

Ability to accurately judge someone's mood and
intentions. Empathy stunts can be about judging a crowd, picking up on
lies, or helping others recover from mental consequences.

### Engineering

Ability to make or break machinery, build
contraptions, and pull off MacGyver-esque feats of ingenuity.
Engineering stunts let you have the gizmo on hand, give bonuses to
building and breaking things, and provide justification for using
Engineering in place of skills like Burglary or Academics under
certain circumstances.

### Fight

Ability to excel at hand-to-hand combat, whether with
weapons or fists. Fight stunts include signature weapons and special
techniques.

### Investigate

Deliberate, careful study and puzzling out mysteries.
Use this to piece together clues or reconstruct a crime scene.
Investigate stunts help you form brilliant deductions or piece
together information more quickly.

### Notice

Ability to pick up details in the moment, spot trouble
before it happens, and generally be perceptive. It contrasts
Investigate, which is for slow, deliberate observation. Notice stunts
sharpen your senses, improve your reaction time, or make you harder to
sneak up on.

### Lore

Secret knowledge about the usage of aetheric powers, especially the knowledge that has been held close by noble families
or underground organizations on how to use powers in specific ways.  Use Academics for scientific categorizations of aetheric
powers. Lore stunts are required to apply that knowledge in the _use_ of aetheric powers.

#### Example
Name: Fireburner Magnussen, Head of Magnussen House's security forces.
High Concept: Fire-powered Heir to the Magnussen Chair

### Physique

Raw power and durability. Physique stunts let you
perform superhuman feats of strength, throw your weight around while
wrestling, and shrug off physical consequences. 

### Provoke

Ability to push people to act the way you want them to.
It's coarse and manipulative, not a positive interaction. Provoke
stunts let you push opponents into foolhardy action, draw aggression
toward you, or scare enemies (assuming they can feel fear).

### Rapport

Building connections with others and working together.
Where Provoke is manipulation, Rapport is sincerity, trust, and
goodwill. Rapport stunts let you sway the crowd, improve
relationships, or build contacts.

### Resources

Access to material things, not just money or direct
ownership. It might reflect your ability to borrow from friends or dip
into an organization's armory. Resources stunts let you use Resources
in place of Rapport or Contacts or give you extra free invokes when
you pay for the best.

### Shoot

All forms of ranged combat, whether guns, throwing knives,
or bow and arrow. Shoot stunts let you make called shots, quick-draw,
or always have a gun handy.

### Stealth

Staying unseen or unheard and escaping when you need to
hide. Stealth stunts let you vanish in plain sight, blend into crowds,
or advance through shadows unseen.

### Will

Mental fortitude, the ability to overcome temptation and to
withstand trauma. Will stunts let you ignore mental consequences,
withstand the mental agony of strange powers, and hold steady against
enemies who provoke you.

## Changes from Fate Condensed

- Renamed "Crafts" to "Engineering"
- Repurposed "Lore" to be about secret knowledge about aetheric powers and how to use them effectively.

title: Consequences and Recovery
---

## **Mild +2**

* A mild consequence is a minor inconvenience, such as:
  * An injury that doesn't require immediate medical attention
  * A small social gaffe or change in surface emotions
* **Examples:** Black Eye, Bruised Hand, Winded, Flustered, Cranky, Temporarily Blinded

### **Mild Recovery**

* In game, when safe, others may roll overcome against 2 (or you can roll overcome against 4\) to **start** your recovery (rename / mark consequence with \* for recovering)
* A recovering mild consequence goes away after surviving **one whole scene**
* A mild consequence (recovering or not) **goes away** with a *Minor Milestone*



## **Moderate +4**

* A moderate consequence is serious impairment that requires dedicated recovery, such as:
  * An injury that requires medical attention
  * Damage to your reputation or emotional problems you can't sleep off
* **Examples:** Deep Cut, First Degree Burn, Exhausted, Drunk, Terrified

### **Moderate Recovery**

* In game, when safe, others may roll overcome against 4 (or you can roll overcome against 6\) to **start** your recovery (rename / mark consequence with \* for recovering)
* Otherwise, a (not recovering) moderate consequence **automatically starts** recovery (rename / mark consequence with \* for recovering) with a *Minor Milestone*
* A recovering moderate consequence goes away after lasting **one whole session**



## **Severe +6**

* A severe consequence is a major impairment that will affect you for a long while such as:
  * A major injury that requires an emergency room visit
  * Serious trauma or relationship-changing harm
* **Examples:** Second-Degree Burn, Compound Fracture, Guts Hanging Out, Crippling Shame, Trauma-Induced Phobia

### **Severe Recovery**

* In game, when safe, others may roll overcome against 6 (or you can roll overcome against 8\) to **start** your recovery (rename / mark consequence with \* for recovering)
* Otherwise, a (not recovering) severe consequence **automatically starts** recovery (rename / mark consequence with \* for recovering) with a *Significant Milestone*
* A recovering severe consequence goes away after lasting **one whole scenario**



## **Extreme +8**

* An extreme consequence is a character-changing impairment
* You must replace an existing aspect with a new one that reflects the extreme consequence

### **Extreme Recovery**

* No option to start recovery with a roll
* An extreme consequence **automatically starts** recovery (rename consequence aspect) with a *Major Milestone*
* Once an extreme consequence has been renamed to indicate recovering, it no longer counts as an extreme consequence (freeing you to take another in the future)
* A formerly extreme consequence aspect (aka started recovery) doesn't just go away, it's just like any other character aspect now

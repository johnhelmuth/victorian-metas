## Claymen… 
  * can change their body or part of their body into almost any shape, keeping the same mass. Often their changed shape will take on a different appearance, like wood, or metal, or stone. Untrained can only do 1 other shape with only a single part of their body, like “Look, ma, I can turn my hand into a knife!” and that’s it.  Trained can change their entire body (or parts of their body) into virtually anything, although individual’s abilities often have specific limitations. Those limited to just changing their faces are often known **Faceless**, see below. *(Maeve Murry, trained)*

## Faceless…
  * can change their face so they look like someone else. Untrained can only do the faces of people they know well, sometimes only 1 other person. Trained can do multiple faces after a glance, very quickly, and there are rumors of those who can change their height and weight as well. (These last may also be referred to as **Claymen**, see above.) *(Emil Blondel, trained)*

## Fleetfoot…
  * can run faster than a horse for a short period of time. Untrained quickly loose steam and must stop completely and rest for 30 minutes or so. Trained can run faster for longer, and recover faster, in only a few moments.

## Green men…
  * can control plants, making them grow and/or move. Untrained users just have very nice bountiful gardens or farms. Trained users can control plants to bind others, or to throw thorns, or can communicate with plants to discover what has happened in their presence, or is happening now. *(Rowan Finnegan, trained)*

## Horseviskra…
  * can control animals, sometimes only specific types of animals. This label is usually applied to valued hansom drivers, coachmen, or jockeys. Sometimes referred to as **Huntsmen**. Sometimes an individual has mixes of abilities as described under **Huntsmen** or **Ratoren**.

## Huntsmen...
  * can communicate, control, and/or sense animals. Untrained can only communicate *or* control *or* sense. Trained can do all three, and more. Sometimes people with less training are referred to as **Ratoren**, especially if they are lower class and/or work as pest control in the cities.  There are also rumors of those who can “ride” an animal, seeing through their eyes and hearing what they hear, while their human body is lethargic and can only act when led by someone else. Other rumors describe **Weirbeast**, those who can take on animal qualities themselves.   *(Hugh Carlson, trained)*

## Ratoren…
  * can communicate or control smaller animals. “Rat-listeners” are usually people from the lower classes who have weak abilities similar to **Huntsmen**.

## Rememberer…
  * can reproduce what they see onto a piece of paper they are touching. Process takes about 30 seconds. Results from untrained use are chaotic and difficult for others to understand what the *Rememberer* saw. Trained use produces photo equivalent or can touch a canvas and create beautiful paintings.

## Stonefist or Stonefeet…
  * can change their fists or feet into stone, or who fists or feet are living stone. Their hits/kicks cause more damage when they connect. Fists or feet of those who are untrained are always stone, the trained can shift them back and forth, and are also trained to be more effective in unarmed combat. This is a strangely common ability.

## Stoneshaper…
  * can shape stone with their hands, like wet clay.  Takes training to do complicated or large shapes quickly.  Everyone can do snake shapes. *(Erin Fahey, untrained)*

## Stoneshifter…
  * can change their entire body into stone. *(Blockhead O’Malley, trained)*

## Strongman…
  * has the strength of many men. Untrained can just lift and easily move weights 2 or 3 times what is expected of a person their size. Highly trained **Strongmen** can lift a loaded wagon and hold it while the wheel is repaired, and can tear a person apart with their bare hands. *(Jarl Hafthor Thorsaet, trained)*

## Tempest…
  * can control the wind, can freeze small amounts of water, change the temperature a few degrees in a room. This is the term used in the Nordic tradition. Celtic traditions use **Windspeaker**. Untrained can only do one or two effects, and those effects are not very strong; e.g. an untrained aetheric might be able to create a wind, but it could do no more than put out a candle. A trained user can create a wind that will move things around a room, create rain from a cloudy sky, etc.

## Truthteller…
  * knows when someone speaks the truth as they know it, and when they don’t.

## Weirbeast…
  * can take on features of animals, such as grow claws like a lion, or the teeth or ears of a wolf. Untrained cannot control the change, which is usually triggered during times of high emotion, sometimes in some sort periodic cycle. Sometimes have abilities similar to those of **Huntsmen**, **Horseviskra**, **Ratoren**, or **Claymen**….

## Windspeaker…
  * can control the wind, can freeze small amounts of water, change the temperature a few degrees in a room. This is the term used in the Celtic tradition. Nordic traditions use **Tempest**. Untrained can only do one or two effects, and those effects are not very strong; e.g. an untrained aetheric might be able to create a wind, but it could do no more than put out a candle. A trained user can create a wind that will move things around a room, create rain from a cloudy sky, etc. *(Cillian O’Connor, trained)*

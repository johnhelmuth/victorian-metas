## Regarding surnames

Noble houses and those descended from noble houses use a different naming scheme based on the two cultures that have combined together in Dyflin.

Nordic-descended houses tend to use patronyms and matronyms combined with clan affiliation, such as “\<name\>, son of \<parent\>, Clan \<clan\>” or “\<name\> daughter of \<parent\>, Clan \<clan\>”, though for newly elevated houses they may just use “\<name\>, of Clan \<clan\>”. Clan names originated from a primary ancestor, and typically end with “ung” or “ing”, meaning “those who are related”. This could be patrilineal or matrilineal depending on the prestige of the primary ancestor.   
*Example*: Erik, son of Bjorn, Clan Leifung

Celtic-descended houses tend to use a similarly sourced clan name, but instead apply the “O’” prefix to the clan name, with no postfix applied.  
*Example*: Cillian O’Connor

Most people in Dyflin do not use family names but have adopted a modern approach of using “dottir” and “son” added to the name of a parent (often the father, but can be the mother too, depending on prestige).  
*Example*: Emil Gorundson

* ***Stoneshifter enforcer for the Blackstones***
* ***Doesn’t get the respect he thinks he deserves***

*Aetheric: Stoneshifter*

Stunt: **Stoneshifter**: Because I hit hard, I do 2 extra shifts on a successful Attack with my bare fists.

Stunt: **Stoneshifter**: Because I can change my entire body into stone, I am immune to blades and bullets from small arms, and get Armor: 2 against blunt force physical attacks (hammers, clubs, maces, etc). (Shifting from human to stone form as part of a successful Defend against any physical Attack means that he changes fast enough for this stunt to apply.)

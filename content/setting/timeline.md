## 1000 AD
Strange powers arise in the a large number of humans and some animals all around the world in a very short period of time. These powers are referred to with the phrase “Aetheric abilities”. It quickly becomes very rare to meet a person who does not have some Aetheric ability, but most people do not ever learn how to effectively use their ability.
Those with aetheric abilities whose application is very obvious begin to dominate society.
